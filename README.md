Hi,

- This is my portfolio.

- Second page About me, i show what i do,
- i am Frontend from Egypt. 
     I creating beautiful websites that are responsive
     to all devices. I am permanently learning new ways to
     increase my skill set to meet my client's needs.
     
     
     
- Third page can see you some project i've done, but not all of my projects, there are some on GitHub.

- the last page there is some ways to connections with me and also can you send a message on my mail.


note : this is first website with react, there is some problem that faced me when i work on this project.

   - i can not put image in react app in the normal way, but i used { Require('./') } for this.
   - swiper.js does not work me, I search for this problem but I did not find solutions to a problem now.
   - important note for me when putting CSSsass in project It didn't work for me in the normal way but a solution was instead of CSS in the files.
